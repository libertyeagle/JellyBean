# Advanced Timely Dataflow

In this section we will cover some of the more advanced topics in timely dataflow. Most of these topics derive from existing concepts, but build up the complexity a level.

Much of what we'll learn about here looks like *control flow*: dataflow patterns that cause our computation to execute in interesting and new ways, other than a straight line of dataflow. These patterns connect back to idioms from sequential imperative data processing, but using progress information to resculpt the movement of data, changing what computation actually occurs.
